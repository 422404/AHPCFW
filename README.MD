#Overview:
This is as basic as I could get a 'CFW' to be. Currently, it loads firm.bin from the SD Card, patches it, and launches it.
There are also screen functions as well as other libs the user can play with. I plan to add in more patches and uses.

At the current point in time, it patches the follwing:

-SVC Access Checks (Untested)

-FIRM Partition Writing (Credit to Delebile, Untested)

-Signature Checks

And there's also some unfinished, but probably easily usable Emu/RedNAND patches.

#Credits:
Laramie14 - Right hand man.

Normmatt - sdmmc and i2c libs.

ChaN - FATFS lib.

Delebile - FIRM Partition patch and being cool overall.

#A9LH Credits:
Seeing as Delebile's code is much more appealing, I decided there'd be no reason to share my implementation. Despite this,
the people who have helped me deserve to be acknowledged.

OctopusRift - Reviving the idea for a N3DS DG. Would've brushed it off otherwise.

Laramie14 - Right hand man, helped with key bruteforcing and verified that O3DS support was indeed possible.

Plutoo and Yellows8 - Arm9loaderhax's discovery and explanation, including the useful infos given at 32c3.

Normmatt - sdmmc libs, i2c libs 1.0.0 CN QR code, CN NAND dumper's load.bin

ChaN - FATFS lib.

3DBrew and it's members - Keeping 3DBrew so full of information.
